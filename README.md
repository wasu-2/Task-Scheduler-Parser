## Script Description

This PowerShell script retrieves all scheduled tasks on the local machine and exports key details about each task to a CSV file for easy review and auditing. The exported information includes the task name, task path, author (user who created the task), run level, action commands, and current task state.

All results are exported into a UTF-8 encoded CSV file suitible for Eric Zimmerman timeline explorer, or other spreadsheet applications.
